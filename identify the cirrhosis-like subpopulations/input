#####  the requir of input
##  R version 4.1.0
#  seurat_obj :  total seurat obj 
#  subtype :  subset of the seurat object (the KNN best result or you want to visualize）   the colnames must be called celltype    eg: 'Hepatocyte'
#  sample_1 & sample_2 & sample_3:   sample, the colnames must be called data_type   eg： 'Cirrhosis'
#  k : the number of marker you want to overlap
#  type_origin_1 & type_origin_2: the subset you want to alignment, eg: 'HCC_PGA5+ Hepa' 
#  gene_number : you should set the number of hvg you want based on diff dataset conditions
#  disp_threshold, weight_threshold :  you should set the threshold based on diff dataset conditions, and could judge based on the results of Plot_hvg 
#  bg.col : color of each subtype
